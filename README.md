# hugoVueSFC

**hugoVueSFC** is an attempt to use Vue's Single-File Components (a.k.a. *.vue files) in Hugo directly.
With a bunch of [shortcodes](https://github.com/indus/hugoVueSFC/tree/main/layouts/shortcodes/vueSFC) and [partials](https://github.com/indus/hugoVueSFC/tree/main/layouts/partials/vueSFC) it makes it easy to include SFCs in posts and pages.
At the moment it doesn't support [`<script setup>`](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html) and [`<style scoped>`](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/guide/scoped-css.html) 😢

But besides that it works quite well... 😃
